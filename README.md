# Evolution

This is a little program that can be used to simulate some basic evolution-ish thing through repetively selecting creatures that live the longest and using their "genome" (a list of events with corresponding actions).

## Possible Actions

* Do Nothing
* Move Forward
* Turn Left
* Turn Right
* Face Left
* Face Up
* Face Right
* Face Down

Dependencies: Mac OS X (for now), SDL, SDL_image, OpenGL
